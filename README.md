This repository contains the files and resources for an interactive IPL dashboard created using Microsoft Power BI. The data used for the dashboard is sourced from Kaggle.

Getting Started
Download the Data:

Visit the Kaggle dataset of your choice containing IPL data. There are several publicly available options, like the one by biswajitbrahmma (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/patrickb1912/ipl-complete-dataset-20082020).
Download the relevant datasets (e.g., matches and ball-by-ball data) in CSV format.

Download and install Microsoft Power BI Desktop from https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=58494.
Load the Data in Power BI Desktop:

Open Power BI Desktop.
Import the downloaded CSV files from Kaggle.
You may need to perform some data cleaning and transformation steps within Power BI to prepare the data for analysis.
Explore and Create Visualizations:

Use Power BI's features to create insightful visualizations like charts, graphs, and tables to analyze various aspects of the IPL data.
This repository does not contain the specific visualizations you created, but you can use your own creative freedom to explore the data.
